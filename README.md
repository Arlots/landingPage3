Take 3 on TOP landing page (for review)

This project is the first culmination of the html/css fundamentals learned in TOP.
I've done this project before (twice), but after taking a break, I've come back to this project to review 
and refamiliarize myself with html/css commands.

This project has four sections + a footer.
Thus, I will be aim to complete the project in four iterations, one per section.

I'm enthusastic and have many ideas, but I will try not to stray from the assignment.
However, since the theme and required pictures are not provided, I've decided to add my own theme: Karate.
